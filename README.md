## About Me
My name is Joe Thomas.  I am making this for a Software Engineering class at Appalachian State University.  I am a Senior Computer Science major that hopes to one day work on video games.  They have always been a part of my life and I am interested on how they are made.  I enjoy playing outside with my dog Panda, golfing, fishing, and wathcing any type of sports.  If you have any questions don't hesitate to reach out and ask!ðŸ˜ƒ
